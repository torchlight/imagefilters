Image filters
=============

A bunch of image filters written in Python 2, using the [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm). Currently only a rudimentary median filter is implemented.

Don't hold your breath; the filters are mainly for research purposes rather than actual usage, and generally alternative implementations of the provided algorithms are available. Even if they aren't, porting shouldn't be too hard.
